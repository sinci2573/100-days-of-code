# 100 Days of Code

## Overview
This repository contains solutions and implementations for the most liked coding problems on LeetCode, solved over 100 days. The goal is to improve problem-solving skills, enhance coding efficiency, and gain a deeper understanding of algorithms and data structures.

## Rules
- Solve at least one coding problem every day for 100 days.
- Focus on a mix of topics including data structures, algorithms, and system design.
- Explore different programming languages and paradigms where applicable.

## Structure
Each day’s work is stored in a separate folder with the following structure:
```
DayXX/
  ├── problem_statement.md  # Description of the problem
  ├── solution.py/java/cpp  # Code implementation
  ├── readme.md             # Explanation of the approach and solution
```

## Topics Covered
- Arrays and Strings
- Linked Lists
- Stacks and Queues
- Trees and Graphs
- Sorting and Searching
- Dynamic Programming
- System Design Concepts

## Contributions
Suggestions and improvements are welcome. Feel free to review and contribute by sharing alternative solutions or optimizations.
