# Problem Statement

Given a string `s`, return the longest palindromic substring in `s`.

A **palindrome** is a string that reads the same backward as forward. The goal is to find the **longest contiguous substring** that satisfies this condition.

## Examples

### Example 1:
Input: s = "babad"
Output: "bab"
Explanation: "aba" is also a valid answer.

### Example 2:
Input: s = "cbbd"
Output: "bb"

### Example 3:
Input: s = "a"
Output: "a"

### Example 4:
Input: s = "ac"
Output: "a"

## Constraints

- `1 <= s.length <= 1000`
- `s` consists of only digits and English letters.
